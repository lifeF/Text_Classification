# Text Classification

One of the most crucial things in your open source project is the `README.md`
file. This repository has a ready-to-copy-paste template you can use for all
your projects.

## Getting started

Copy the `README-default.md` file for yourself and start editing! At the root of
your project, run:

This adds the `README.md` file to your git repository, creates a commit for it
and pushes it to GitHub (or other preferred remote repository).

## Features

This project makes it easy to:
* Bootstrap your open source project properly
* Make sure everyone gets what you're trying to achieve with your project
* Follow simple instructions for a perfect `README.md`

## Contributing

As I use this for my own projects, I know this might not be the perfect approach
for all the projects out there. If you have any ideas, just
[open an issue][issues] and tell me what you think.

If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and make changes as
you'd like. Pull requests are warmly welcome.

If your vision of a perfect `README.md` differs greatly from mine, it might be
because your projects are for vastly different. In this case, you can create a
new file `README-yourplatform.md` and create the perfect boilerplate for that.
